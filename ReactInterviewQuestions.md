# React Interview Questions

This is a collection of general questions about React that can be used when interviewing a candidate claiming React experience. Most of these questions are pulled directly from the React documentation and are questions that I feel every React developer should know the answer to. 

- Why might you use `react.cloneElement` when building an application?
- Explain the concept of ownership in React
- Given the following component code, what will happen? 

  ```
  export default class SomeButton extends React.Component {
    constructor() {

    }

    componentWillMount() {

    }

  }
  ```

- How would a parent programatically reference its child components
- Can you manipulate `this.props.children`? If so, how? 
- What is the `key` attribute used for?
- How do you tell React to skip the processing of a sub-tree when it is rendering? 
- Explain the concept of `propTypes`
- Why might you use a mixin? 
- Sample code about AutoBinding methods
- When is the `...` (Object Rest Spread) syntax useful?
- Name two ways you can find a component once it has been mounted to the DOM. 
- How would you render React components in a server environment?
